# Chinese Zodiac Calculator

## Description

This is a simple Java console application that calculates the user's Chinese Zodiac sign based on their birth year.

It uses the modulo operation (`% 12`) to determine the remainder when the birth year is divided by 12, and maps the remainder to a specific zodiac animal using a `switch` statement.

## How It Works

1. The user is asked to input their birth year.
2. The program calculates `birthYear % 12`.
3. Using a `switch` statement, the program assigns the corresponding Chinese Zodiac animal.
4. The result is printed to the console.
